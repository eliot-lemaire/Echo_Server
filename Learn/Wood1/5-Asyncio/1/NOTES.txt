Learn how two programs communicate over a network using TCP and Python's basic socket module. Create a simple server that handles one client at a time.

Commands

# Terminal 1 - Run the server
python3 blocking_echo.py

# Terminal 2 - Test the server
printf 'hello\n' | nc 127.0.0.1 9001

    Explain what a socket is in client-server communication.

    Create a TCP server that binds to an address and port.

    Accept a client connection and exchange data.

    Run the server and connect to it using nc (netcat).

    Identify the key differences between client and server socket usage.
